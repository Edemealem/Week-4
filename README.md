# Week 4- Project Overview

This project explores customer purchasing behavior and predicts store sales using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The final goal is to serve predictions via a web interface.

## Objectives

- **Explore Customer Purchasing Behavior**
- **Predict Store Sales**
- **Implement Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches**
- **Serve Predictions on a Web Interface**

## Task 1: Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior

### Key Steps Taken

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Built pipelines to handle outliers and missing data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted visualizations to understand data interactions and trends related to customer behavior.

3. **Key Questions Addressed**:
   - Examined the impact of promotions, holidays, and competitor distance on sales.
   - Analyzed seasonal purchasing behaviors and customer trends.

4. **Deliverables**:
   - An exploratory analysis notebook (`Task 1.ipynb`) located in the `notebooks` folder, providing insights and visualizations.

### Logging

- Implemented logging for traceability and reproducibility.
